The Weather App is a simple Flutter application that allows users to get the current weather information based on their device's location.

    Features
        * Fetches the user's current location using the Geolocator package.
        * Retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the http package.
        * Displays the current date, weather description, and temperature in Fahrenheit.
        * Shows an appropriate weather icon based on the weather description.
        
This is a README file for a Flutter app that displays the current weather information based on the user's location. The app uses the following packages and APIs:

•  [geolocator]: A Flutter plugin to easily handle location services and permissions.

•  [http]: A Flutter package to make HTTP requests and work with JSON data.

•  [intl]: A Flutter package to format dates and numbers according to different locales.

•  [OpenWeatherMap API]: A free API to get current and forecast weather data for any location.

The app consists of a single widget, WeatherWidget, which is a stateful widget that fetches the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the user's current latitude and longitude obtained from the geolocator package. The widget displays the date, temperature, and weather description in a card with a rounded border. The widget also shows an appropriate icon based on the weather condition, using the CupertinoIcons package.

The app handles errors and exceptions by showing a Cupertino dialog with an error message if getting the current location or fetching the weather data fails. The app also uses the kDebugMode constant from the foundation package to print the JSON data from the API response in debug mode.

The app uses the following constants and methods:

•  WeatherData: A class that holds the weather information such as temperature, weather description, and date.

•  WeatherWidget: A stateful widget that displays the weather information in a card.

•  WeatherWidgetState: The state class of the WeatherWidget, which has a state variable that stores the weather data and initializes it with some default values. The state class also overrides the initState method to get the current location and fetch the weather data when the widget initializes, and updates the state variable with the result. The state class also defines the build method that returns the widget tree for displaying the weather information and icon.

•  getCurrentLocation: A method that uses the geolocator package to get the current device location and returns a Future<Position> object. The method checks if the location service is enabled and if the permission is granted, and handles errors accordingly.

•  getWeatherData: A method that uses the http package to make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the latitude and longitude parameters, and returns a Future<WeatherData> object. The method builds the API URL with query parameters, including the API key and units, and parses the JSON data from the response. The method extracts the temperature and weather description from the data and creates a WeatherData object. The method also handles errors and exceptions during the network call.

•  getWeatherIcon: A method that takes a weather condition as a parameter and returns an Icon object based on a switch statement. The method uses different icons from the CupertinoIcons package for different weather conditions such as clear, clouds, rain, snow, thunderstorm, etc.

The app is written in Dart language and follows the Flutter style guide for formatting and naming conventions. The app uses comments to explain the code logic and functionality. The app is compatible with both Android and iOS devices.
